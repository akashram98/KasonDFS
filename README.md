# KasonDFS
To emulate and build a system which replicates the capabilities of other distributed file systems like HDFS[Hadoop Distributed File System]. This system would also include the functionalities of some of the linux based OS commands supported by HDFS and there will also be the added option of using built in and user defined search based queries which would give the user a very high level understanding of the dataset incorporated into the system and the procedure to draw useful insights based on some frequently explored questions.

PROJECT DESIGN:
The project can be divided on a broad scale into three distinct steps each representing a unique component of the system. The three steps are very briefly described as below:
• STEP 1: Emulated Distributed File System component
• STEP 2: Map Reduce based search function component
• STEP 3: Command line based interface component
